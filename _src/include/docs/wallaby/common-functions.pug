  h3 Refresher for Commonly Used KIPR Robot Controller Library Functions
  p
    | The most commonly used KIPR Robot Controller Library functions for robot control are ones for accessing sensor
    | ports, operating DC motors, and suspending a program while a motor action is in progress. A quick refresher
    | for the ones typically used follows:
  table(style='background-color: #f0f0f0;')
    tr
      td
        br
        .Indent
          code
            a(name='display_printfx')
            | display_printf(&lt;
          i col
          code &gt;, &lt;
          i row
          code &gt;, &lt;
          i printf-arguments
          code &gt;);
          dl
            dd
              | The purpose of this function is to display formatted output at a specific (column, row) location
              | on the KIPR Robot Controller program console screen using standard 
              code printf
              |  formatting. The column range for the display is 0 to 41. For the 3 button (A,B,C) console
              |  display, the row range is 0 to 9, and for the 6 button (X,Y,Z,A,B,C) console display,
              |  the row range is 0 to 7. Excess data printed to a row is truncated (i.e. text does not
              |  wrap). Printing ' 
              code \n
              | ' using 
              code display_printf
              |  will cause undesired
              |  display results.
          code
            a(name='digitalx')
            | digital(&lt;
          i port#
          code &gt;)
          dl
            dd
              | For a switch plugged into the port, returns 0 if the switch is open and returns 1 if the
              | switch is closed. Digital ports are numbered 8-15. Typically used with button (switch)
              | sensors employed in bumpers or to detect limit of travel. Will also work with sensors
              | having an analog response by interpreting the voltage reading as 0 or 1.
          code
            a(name='analogx')
            | analog(&lt;
          i port#
          code &gt;);
          dl
            dd
              | For an analog sensor plugged into the port, returns a value scaled to the range 0-1023 representing
              | the analog voltage variation produced by the sensor. Analog ports are numbered 0-7. Light
              | sensors and range finders are examples of sensors used in analog ports. For some sensors,
              | in particular, the 'ET' distance sensor used for robotics, the port's pull up resistor
              | (enabled by default) has to be disabled for the analog values to be meaningful.
          code
            a(name='analog_etx')
            | analog_et(&lt;
          i port#
          code &gt;);
          dl
            dd
              | For an analog sensor plugged into the port, disables the port's pullup resistor and returns
              | a value scaled to the range 0-1023 representing the analog voltage variation produced
              | by the sensor. Analog ports are numbered 0-7. This is the function normally used with
              | the 'ET' distance sensor used for robotics, which has a pullup sensor already integrated
              | into its circuitry.
          code
            a(name='msleepx')
            | msleep(&lt;
          i int_msecs
          code &gt;);
          dl
            dd
              | Causes the function to pause for the specified number of milliseconds (motor action continues).
          code
            a(name='mavx')
            | mav(&lt;
          i motor_#
          code &gt;, &lt;
          i vel
          code &gt;);
          dl
            dd
              | Turns on the specified motor port, maintaining the specified motor velocity using PID (proportional,
              | integral, derivative) motor control. The motor number is an integer in the range 0 to
              | 3. Motor velocity is an integer between -1000 and 1000 where 0 means the motor is off
              | and negative numbers direct the motor to run in the reverse direction for how it is plugged
              | into the motor port.
          code
            a(name='motorx')
            | motor(&lt;
          i motor_#
          code &gt;, &lt;
          i motor_power
          code &gt;);
          dl
            dd
              | Turns on the specified motor port at the PWM power level specified, where a positive power
              | value operates the motor in the direction as 
              code fd
              |  and a negative value operates
              |  it in the reverse direction. The motor number is an integer in the range 0 to 3. The
              |  power setting is -100 to 100 representing percentage of full power. Motor response with
              |  respect to power is non-linear (i.e., doubling power does not double motor velocity).
              |  Moreover, motor velocity for a power setting varies according to load. In contrast, PID
              |  motor control varies the PWM power applied to try to establish and maintain a specified
              |  motor velocity.

          dl
            dd
              | Turns of the specified motor port at maximum PWM (pulse width modulation) power for the motor's
              | forward direction for how the motor is plugged in. The motor number is an integer between

          code

          dl
            dd
              | Turns off the specified motor port. Once a motor port is turned on, a motor plugged into
              | the port will continue operating until the motor port is turned off or the program terminates
              | (which turns off all motor ports).
          code
            a(name='aox')

          dl
            dd Turns all motor ports off.
