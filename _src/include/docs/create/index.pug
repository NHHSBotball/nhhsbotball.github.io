  h3 Create Function Library
  p
    | The functions in the KIPR Robot Controller Library for controlling an iRobot Create module provide an interface
    | between a program on the KIPR Robot Controller and the Create Open Interface (
    a(href='http://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/hrd/create/Create%20Open%20Interface_v2.pdf')
      | http://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/hrd/create/Create%20Open%20Interface_v2.pdf
    | ).
    |  Each Create function in the KIPR Robot Controller Library is designed to send the Create a series of Open
    |  Interface commands that cause the Create to perform some action. A script of Open Interface commands can
    |  also be downloaded to the Create to be played later (see the library function 
    code create_write_byte
    | ).
  p
    | The KIPR Robot Controller communicates with the iRobot Create via a (TTL) serial connection. Functions included
    | in the KIPR Robot Controller Library for the iRobot Create send serial byte code sequences to the Create
    | over the serial connection, making it possible to operate the Create without having to reference the Open
    | Interface guide. These sequences cover the large majority of actions users typically want to have performed
    | by a Create module (e.g., drive forward at a given speed, determine how far the Create has traveled, etc).
    | They also provide a means for the KIPR Robot Controller to directly control an iRobot Create.
  p
    | A Create script is a (limited) sequence of pre-defined iRobot Create byte code commands ordered to perform some
    | set of actions independent of external control. In contrast to other commands, a command to start a script
    | disables serial communications until the script has finished. See the 
    a(href='#Create_script_example') example program
    |  below for more information on user defined scripts.
  p
    | The KIPR Robot Controller Library functions for moving the iRobot Create are non-blocking, so when a movement
    | command is sent to the iRobot Create, its trajectory will continue until a different Create movement function
    | is executed on the KIPR Robot Controller. In contrast, once a script is started on the Create it will run
    | to completion, during which time the connection to the KIPR Robot Controller is ignored. The iRobot Create
    | may also be used to play MIDI music. Up to 16 songs may be downloaded to the iRobot Create from a song array
    | on the KIPR Robot Controller. See the Create Open Interface manual for details on note and duration codes.
  p
    | The library functions for accessing Create sensor data return either the requested data or an error code. A return
    | value greater than 100,000 is used to indicate an error occurred, where the error number is given by 100,000
    | + 
    code &lt;
    i Create-Serial-Interface-Packet-Number
    code &gt;
    | . For example, a code of
    |  100,007 indicates an error occurred when requesting bumper or wheel drop sensor status. Sensor packet numbers
    |  range from 7 to 42 as described in the Create Open Interface manual.
  p
    | The Create Open Interface manual has details concerning the physical characteristics of the iRobot Create module
    | and descriptions of how to use the various byte code commands.
