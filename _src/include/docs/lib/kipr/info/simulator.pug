  h3 KIPR Robot Controller Simulator
  p
    | When the KIPR Software Suite is installed, in addition to the KISS IDE, a graphical simulator is installed which
    | can be selected as a target for a project being developed using the KISS IDE. The simulator provides a simulated
    | robot and a stylized operating environment for the robot, including a simulated (Botball style) starting
    | light. For motors and sensors incorporated into the simulated robot, side panels show motor and sensor response
    | values. A representation of the KIPR Robot Controller console screen is also provided for display output.
    | The simulated robot can be arbitrarily positioned in its environment using keyboard entry and mouse functions,
    | including turning the simulated light on/off.
  p
    | The simulator provides an effective means for trying out functions in the KIPR Robot Controller Library and for
    | testing small examples when learning how to use a library function. More fundamentally, it provides a user
    | friendly means for obtaining visual feedback for those who are learning to program in C.
  p
    | Perhaps most importantly, the simulator provides means for testing KIPR Robot Controller program code before
    | downloading a project to a KIPR Robot Controller, speeding up the process of obtaining a working program
    | for a KIPR Robot Controller controlled robot. No simulator can anticipate every variation a real robot might
    | encounter in performing its mission, but in general, simulation serves to limit the amount of program tweaking
    | required to attain acceptable performance on the actual robot.

  h4 Running a Project
  p
    | If a program's action does not involve the KIPR Robot Controller Library functions, its target can be "My Computer".
    | When KIPR Robot Controller Library functions are being used, the target needs to be "My KIPR Robot Controller
    | Simulator" or an attached KIPR Robot Controller. If no KIPR Robot Controller is attached, the simulator can
    | be used to see what a program does.

      | If the project is the only project open in the IDE, it is automatically the

      |  the target for compilation, launching the simulator if it is the selected target (and not already running).
      |  If there are any compilation errors they are reported back to the IDE to be displayed in its results
      |  panel. If the 
      i Run
      |  button was used in the IDE, the target will also run the project. For the Simulator,
      |  the names of projects loaded into the Simulator will be displayed in a side panel (analogous to the 
      i Programs
      |  listing on the KIPR Robot Controller).
